# 🕹️ Checkers Game – Flutter Application

A fully functional, cross-platform checkers game built using **Flutter** and **Dart**, featuring a custom game engine and an intelligent AI opponent powered by the **minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**.

## 💡 About the Project

This application was developed as part of an academic assignment, with the goal of creating a complete checkers game from scratch. It includes turn-based logic, move validation, AI decision-making, and a polished, modern user interface.

The project is designed to demonstrate real-world software development skills including architecture design, algorithm implementation, and UI/UX development.

## 🧠 AI Engine: Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

The AI logic is implemented using a **depth-limited minimax algorithm**, optimized with **alpha-beta pruning** to skip unnecessary branches in the decision tree. This results in faster move evaluations while maintaining competitive gameplay.

**AI Highlights:**
- Predicts future board states recursively
- Applies an evaluation function based on:
  - Piece count and type (normal or king)
  - Aggressive capture opportunities
  - Positional advantage
- Uses alpha-beta pruning to reduce time complexity
- Prioritizes attacking and king promotion behavior
